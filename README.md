2. **Dictionary**
    - a. Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.
    - b. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries.
    - c. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.
    - d. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
    - e. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
* **Tuple**
    - a. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.
    - b. Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers and print one item.
    - c. Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.
    - d. Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.
    - e. Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.
* **Set**
    - a. Write a Python program to add member(s) in a set and clear a set.
    - b. Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set
    - c. Write a Python program to create an intersection, Union, difference of sets.
    - d. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.
    - e. Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts from list, tuple, dictionary.
3. **Find Captain Room Number**
    ```
    Sample Input:
    5
    1 2 3 6 5 4 4 2 5 3 6 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 3 6 8 4 3 1 5 6 2
    Sample Output:
    8
    ```
    *Explanation: The list of room numbers contains 31 elements. Since K is 5, there must be 6 groups of families. In the given list, all of the numbers repeat 5 times except for room number 8. Hence, 8 is the Captain's room number.

4. **Find runner-up from given list**
    ```
    Sample Input:
    5
    2 3 6 6 5
    Sample Output:
    5
    ```
    *Explanation: Given list is [2,3,6,6,5]. The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.*

5.  **Convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.**
    ```
    Sample Input: HackerRank.com presents "Pythonist 2".
    Sample Output: hACKERrANK.COM PRESENTS "pYTHONIST 2".
    ```

6.  **You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification.**
    ```
    Sample Input:
    4   
    bcdef
    abcdefg
    bcde
    bcdef
    Sample Output:
    3
    2 1 1
    ```
    *Explanation: There are 3 distinct words. Here, "bcdef" appears twice in the input at the first and last positions. The other words appear once each. The order of the first appearances are "bcdef", "abcdefg" and "bcde" which corresponds to the output.*

7.  **Glossary: Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. If there are odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for lapindrome.**
    - For example gaga is a lapindrome, since the two halves ga and ga have the same characters with same frequency.
    - Also, abccab, rotor and xyzxy are a few examples of lapindromes.
    - Note that abbaab is NOT a lapindrome. The two halves contain the same characters but their frequencies do not match.

    **Question: Your program needs to tell if the input strings are a lapindrome.** (*[source: CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/LAPIN)*)
    ```
    Sample Input:
    6
    gaga
    abcde
    rotor
    xyzxy
    abbaab
    ababc
    Sample Output:
    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO
    ```
8.  **Program in Python to implement a Stack Data Structure using Class and Objects, with push, pop, and traversal method.**
9.  **Consider an example of declaring the examination result. Design three classes: Student, Exam, and Result. The Student class has data members such as those representing rollNumber, Name, etc. Create the class Exam by inheriting Student class. The Exam class adds fields representing the marks scored in six subjects. Derive Result from the Exam class, and it has its own fields such as total_marks. Write an interactive program to model this relationship.**
10.  **Generate PDF file of your Mark-sheet**
